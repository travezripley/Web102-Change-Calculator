# Web-102 Change Calculator

March 4th, 2019

## Hey guys, thanks for Checking out my code in my Github

What you see here is a "Change Calculator" Web app.
This is what happens, Upon loading the app, the interface has two inputs "Amount Due" and "Amount Received".
This is where the client inputs the price of the item(s) requested from the customer and the amount of currency in "USA currency" the client recieves from the customer.
Pressing the "Calculate Change" button will display the change broken down in "Dollars, Quarters, Dimes, Nickles and Penny's returned to the customer.

## The code was written in HTML, CSS and Javascript

## To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing

Install the dependencies via the terminal by typing **npm install**.

Next, in the terminal, type **static** to start the app on your local node server.

Open the server at **localhost:8080** in the browser of your choice.
